t5148.scala:4: error: Symbol 'type <none>.Request.Wrapper' is missing from the classpath.
This symbol is required by 'value scala.tools.nsc.interpreter.Imports.wrapper'.
Make sure that type Wrapper is in your classpath and check for conflicting dependencies with `-Ylog-classpath`.
A full rebuild may help if 'Imports.class' was compiled against an incompatible version of <none>.Request.
